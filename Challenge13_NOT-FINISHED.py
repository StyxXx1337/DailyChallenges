# [ HARD ]
# Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring
# that contains at most k distinct characters.
# For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".
# s = "abbbbbbbcccccccccccdd" k = 3, result = "bbbbbbbcccccccccccdd"
